## Happin Developer Technical Interview

This is the project that your team is working on together. There is a requirement that, Happin should be able to extract data from other websites when provided with an URL, particularly, trackie.com. ([Example](https://www.trackie.com/online-registration/event/nccp-course-foundations-of-coach-theory-modules-of-sport-and-club-coach/472081/#.YXav6RrMK70))

You, as a developer of Happin, will be working collaboratively with your team on this feature. Your teammates have accomplished the framework of the application, including the data model, router, interfaces and abstract classes. You will need to implement the abstract class to finally achieve the requirement.

As a fullstack developer, you will also build a React UI to allow user submit the URL in a form, to the backend API, and display the responses to the user. (Please feel free to either create a React app in this repo or in a separate repo.)

The code is self-explaining, but there could be bugs & poor practices. Please try your best to understand the code, fix any bugs you have found, and implement the feature.

Please make sure first to start up the application on your local. As an acceptance criteria, the application should be able to start on any machine. Please provide the instruction on how it should be setup.

Please don't hesitate to contact us for any questions or clarifications needed!
